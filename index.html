                    <p>I am currently a SQL Query Report and Python Developer who works with CTR Maine to create Desktop
                        and Web Service interfaces
                        for a hosted Time and Attendance Software using SOAP API and Direct File Manipulation. I know
                        how to create python scripts
                        to create interface structures to convert files into importable data formats including date/time
                        stamp management, data
                        processing, and graphing data.
                    </p>
                    <p>I have developed crucial relationships with clients which has gained increase revenue for the CTR
                        Maine. I even stepped into
                        the secondary side of the business of security by taking incoming SQL Reports and creating a
                        time sheet for employees based on
                        their actual entrance and exit of the building.
                    </p>
                    <p>I am currently attending University of New Hampshire bootcamp for Full Stack Developer. I have
                        also producing 3D assets for Maya,
                        Blender and 3D Max. I have an associate degree in Character Animation from Brooks College. I
                        have taken courses from Animation Mentor
                        where I was taught Python to enhance his ability with animation by using scripting.
                    </p>
                    <p>Outside of work, I have many interests. I am involved in Hack Portland and I join their game dev,
                        python, and robotics monthly meetings.
                        I organize a weekly role-playing session which has helped me develop a strong problem solving,
                        social interactions, and creative thinking.
                        I am an avid video game player who not only plays but works on building them.
