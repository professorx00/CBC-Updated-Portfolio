                        <p class="bodyInfo">I am currently a SQL Query Report and Python Developer who works with CTR Maine to create Desktop and Web Service interfaces for a hosted Time and Attendance Software using SOAP API and Direct File Manipulation. I know how to create python scripts to create interface structures to convert files into importable data formats including date/time stamp management, data processing, and graphing data.</p>

                        <p class="bodyInfo">I have developed crucial relationships with clients which has gained increase revenue for the CTR Maine. I even stepped into the secondary side of the business of security by taking incoming SQL Reports and creating a time sheet for employees based on their actual entrance and exit of the building.</p>
                                
                        <p class="bodyInfo">I am currently attending University of New Hampshire bootcamp for Full Stack Developer. I have also producing 3D assets for Maya, Blender and 3D Max. I have an associate degree in Character Animation from Brooks College. I have taken courses from Animation Mentor where I was taught Python to enhance his ability with animation by using scripting.</p>
                                
                        <p class="bodyInfo">Outside of work, I have many interests. I am involved in Hack Portland and I join their game dev, python, and robotics monthly meetings. I organize a weekly role-playing session which has helped me develop a strong problem solving, social interactions, and creative thinking. I am an avid video game player who not only plays but works on building them.</p>
